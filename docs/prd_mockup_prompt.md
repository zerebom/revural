<Create a professional web application mockup figure>
showing a sequence of 4 full-screen web application views, arranged horizontally in a single high-resolution image. Each view must be in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The screens demonstrate a user journey for an "AI-powered PRD Review Tool" featuring a **document review-style 2-pane layout**.

<APP SPECIFIC CUSTOMIZATION>
Application Core: A SaaS tool where AI agents review a Product Requirements Document (PRD). The core experience is a side-by-side view where the full PRD text is on the left, and a list of AI-generated comments appears on the right. Selecting a comment highlights the relevant text in the document.
Primary Features (in 2-pane document review layout):
1.  **PRD Submission Screen:**
    *   **Left Pane:** A large, welcoming text area for pasting the PRD.
    *   **Right Pane:** Configuration options, including "Product Type" and "Review Focus", with a prominent "Initiate AI Review" button at the bottom.
2.  **Initial Review Screen:**
    *   **Left Pane:** Displays the user's **full PRD text**, scrollable.
    *   **Right Pane:** Displays a scrollable **list of all AI-generated issues/comments**. Each list item should briefly show the agent name and the beginning of the comment.
3.  **Issue Highlight & Dialogue Screen:**
    *   **Left Pane:** The full PRD text is still visible, but the specific section related to the selected issue is now **highlighted**. The view has automatically scrolled to this highlighted section.
    *   **Right Pane:** The selected comment from the list is now **expanded**, showing the full comment text and a **chat interface** below it, ready for the user to ask follow-up questions to the AI.
4.  **Review Summary Screen:**
    *   **Left Pane:** Shows the overall summary, perhaps with key metrics from the review.
    *   **Right Pane:** Lists all identified issues with their respective status tags (e.g., "Resolved", "Pending"). A large "Export as Markdown" button is at the bottom.
Visual Theme: Clean, professional, and modern design with a calming blue and gray color palette. Clear typography (e.g., Inter or a similar sans-serif font), high contrast for readability, and intuitive UI components. The overall feel should be trustworthy and efficient.
Target Audience: Product Managers (PdMs) in tech companies, especially in B2B SaaS startups to mid-sized enterprises.
<END CUSTOMIZATION>

DETAILED VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS:
Device Frame: Full-screen web application view, minimizing browser chrome (tabs/URL bar can be very subtle or omitted to maximize the content area).
Screen Resolution: Each of the 4 views must strictly adhere to a **16:9 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1920x1080).
Background Setting: Subtle, neutral light gray or off-white background.
Lighting: Soft, even lighting with minimal shadows for a clean, professional presentation.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
The application must feature a consistent **2-pane layout** across all screens, with a clear visual connection (like highlighting) between the two panes.
Modern web components (e.g., resembling Shadcn/UI or Ant Design).
Clear typography hierarchy and consistent spacing (8pt grid system).
Interactive elements are clearly distinguishable with appropriate states (hover, active, selected).
Realistic, meaningful content derived from the PRD. Show actual PRD text on the left and relevant AI comments on the right.
Clear visual flow from left to right, demonstrating the user's progression from submission to a deep-dive on a specific issue.

COMPOSITION AND STYLE:
Arrange 4 full-screen (16:9) mockups in a horizontal line with minimal spacing.
Each screen should be clearly labeled at the top (e.g., "1. PRD Submission", "2. Initial Review").
The color palette must be consistent across all four screens.
Use subtle depth and shadows to make the mockups look professional.
Show indicators of interaction, such as a mouse pointer clicking a comment on the right in screen 2, leading to the highlighted state in screen 3.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single cohesive figure, 4K resolution minimum, of professional presentation quality. Photorealistic rendering of the application views with perfect integration.
