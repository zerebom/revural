<Create a professional web application mockup figure>
showing a sequence of 4 full-screen web application views, arranged horizontally in a single high-resolution image. Each view must be in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The screens demonstrate a user journey for an **"AI-powered Document Review Tool"** featuring a document review-style 2-pane layout.

<APP SPECIFIC CUSTOMIZATION>
Application Core: A SaaS tool where AI agents review a user's document. The core experience is a side-by-side view where the full document text is on the left, and a list of AI-generated comments appears on the right. Selecting a comment highlights the relevant text in the document.
Primary Features (in 2-pane document review layout):
1.  **Document Submission Screen:**
    *   **Left Pane:** A large, welcoming text area for pasting the document text.
    *   **Right Pane:** Configuration options, including "Document Type" (e.g., "Legal Contract", "Technical Specification") and "Review Focus", with a prominent "Initiate AI Review" button at the bottom.
2.  **Initial Review Screen (Triage View):**
    *   **Left Pane:** Displays the user's **full document text**, scrollable.
    *   **Right Pane:** Displays a scrollable list of **collapsible accordions**, one for each AI-generated issue. Each accordion header should briefly show the agent name, a summary of the comment, and a severity icon.
3.  **Issue Highlight & Dialogue Screen (Deep Dive View):**
    *   **Left Pane:** The full document text is still visible, but the specific section related to the selected issue is now **clearly highlighted**. The view has automatically scrolled to this highlighted section.
    *   **Right Pane:** The selected accordion from the list is now **expanded**, showing the full comment text and a **chat interface** below it. The other accordions remain collapsed but visible.
4.  **Review Summary Screen:**
    *   **Left Pane:** Shows an overall summary and key metrics from the review.
    *   **Right Pane:** Lists all identified issues with their respective status tags (e.g., "Resolved", "Pending"). A large "Export as Markdown" button is at the bottom.
Visual Theme: Clean, professional, and modern design with a calming blue and gray color palette. Clear typography (e.g., Inter or a similar sans-serif font), high contrast for readability, and intuitive UI components. The overall feel should be trustworthy and efficient.
Target Audience: Professionals who work with documents, such as Product Managers, Lawyers, Technical Writers, and Marketers.
<END CUSTOMIZATION>

DETAILED VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS:
Device Frame: Full-screen web application view, minimizing browser chrome (tabs/URL bar can be very subtle or omitted to maximize the content area).
Screen Resolution: Each of the 4 views must strictly adhere to a **16:9 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1920x1080).
Background Setting: Subtle, neutral light gray or off-white background.
Lighting: Soft, even lighting with minimal shadows for a clean, professional presentation.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
The application must feature a consistent **2-pane layout** across all screens, with a clear visual connection (like highlighting) between the two panes.
Modern web components (e.g., resembling Shadcn/UI or Ant Design), especially a well-designed accordion component.
Clear typography hierarchy and consistent spacing (8pt grid system).
Interactive elements are clearly distinguishable with appropriate states (hover, active, selected).
Realistic, meaningful content. Show actual document text (e.g., a clause from a contract) on the left and relevant AI comments on the right.
Clear visual flow from left to right, demonstrating the user's progression from submission to a deep-dive on a specific issue.

COMPOSITION AND STYLE:
Arrange 4 full-screen (16:9) mockups in a horizontal line with minimal spacing.
Each screen should be clearly labeled at the top (e.g., "1. Document Submission", "2. Triage View").
The color palette must be consistent across all four screens.
Use subtle depth and shadows to make the mockups look professional.
Show indicators of interaction: on screen 2, a mouse pointer should be **hovering over an accordion**, causing a **subtle highlight** on the left pane. On screen 3, that accordion should be shown as **clicked and expanded**, with a **stronger highlight** on the corresponding text in the left pane.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single cohesive figure, 4K resolution minimum, of professional presentation quality. Photorealistic rendering of the application views with perfect integration.
