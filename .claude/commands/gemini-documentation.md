## Gemini Documentation

`gemini` is Google Gemini CLI. Gemini excels in writing, so you should use it for documentation, or proofreading.

Run `gemini` via Task Tool with `gemini --yolo -p '...(instruction)...'`.

The more you describe the instruction in detail, the better. If you ask Gemini to write or update a document rather than proofreading, you should provide a comprehensive background information like what is written in `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md`.

Documentation or proofreading is done automatically by Gemini.

```bash
gemini --yolo -p "...(instruction)..."
```
